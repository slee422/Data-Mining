# Projects from Intro to Data Warehousing & Data Mining Course
These are programming assignments I submitted for the intro to data mining course I took at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
## Building a Random Forest From Scratch
I wrote the code for the decision tree and then used that code to write the random forest algorithm. The code is capable of running within 3 minutes for the datasets we were given to test on. 

## Frequent Pattern Mining using the Apriori Algorithm
This objective of this project was to perform frequent itemset mining and output the outlier resilient itemsets into a text file, in sorted order.
