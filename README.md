# Data Mining: Building a Random Forest From Scratch
This is the programming assignment I submitted for the intro to data mining course I took at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I wrote the code for the decision tree and then used that code to write the random forest algorithm. The code is capable of running within 3 minutes for the datasets we were given to test on.
